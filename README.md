# Interview Assignment 2

Welcome. We have received three data files from different data sources that we need to amalgamate into a single data store. More files will follow from the same sources, so we should create a program that will process these files and update our data store.

Feel free to build this solution using any technology and programming language you are comfortable using. **This is not a memory test** - you may refer to online documentation to get the job done.

The resulting data store can be as simple as a single file in the format of your choice or a more advanced solution using a database. But the data store must be structured to only have the following data elements:

* First Name
* Last Name
* Age
* Credit Score

Please try to keep the solution to under an hour. If time is short, only process two out of the three files.

Good luck!
